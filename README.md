## ðŸ‘‹ Hi there! I am 6100m!

I like to hack a lot of things, ranging from ARM based devices like iPhones and various Nintendo consoles, to having interest in hacking Androids and pissing myself laughing at ridiculous chinese bootleg stuff, such as the infamous "cracked" Pokemon SNES bootlegs. I even enjoy PC hacking and exploitation in many other places, but I've recently taken interest in reverse engineering many of the networking servers and protocols Nintendo made. I am moderating and working on NewWFC and ReRandnet, also! I also have strong beliefs in privacy, and I am a bit easily offended when people critcize my code a bit too much (My code is not the greatest, honestly, but don't get heated at me about it and just guide me to be better.) and I also am a big weeb, and I often over-complicate things, but I try to give things maximum quality at all times!
